### Examinate solving a Kaggle audio Problem using CNNs 
* Preprocessing is done in `preprocess.py`
* Model built in `train_model.py`

##### Approach
* Transformed data from Kaggle to Spectrograms labeled from 0 to 23 (Y is a Vector with |Y|=24).
* Used CNN for the Multi-Label Classification.
* Model is still can't train and further preprocessing need to be done.
